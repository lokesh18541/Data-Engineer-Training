difference between DBMS and RDBMS

while both DBMS and RDBMS are systems for managing databases, RDBMS enforces a structured and relational approach, providing features like ACID properties, normalization, 
and schema enforcement, making it suitable for more complex and larger-scale applications.

DBMS Example: Microsoft Access is an example of a DBMS. It allows users to create and manage databases but doesn't 
enforce a strict structure or relationships between tables.


RDBMS Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database are examples of RDBMS. They enforce a relational structure,
support ACID properties, and are suitable for handling large-scale and complex datasets.
